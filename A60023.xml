         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:100330:3"/>five hundred years, until <hi>Hippocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi> reſtored it unto its former lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, who in writing was the firſt Founder of it. With whoſe writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings no Philoſopher ever found fault, as <hi>Galen</hi> affirmes. And his writings ſtand as firme at this day, as if it were written in Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnes of braſs, few innovations were ever taken notice of. <hi>Galen</hi> in his comments makes <hi>Hippocrates</hi> our Great Maſter, and applaudes him (as I may ſay) to the Stars. But now we find many to forſake their own and old Maſter. We ſee too many new opinions in this later age are crept into the world, but by what right or warrant I will not determine at preſent. Tis more then enough that we ſee ſo many kickſhaws in all ſciences, as new forged concluſions in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy, and new Paradoxes in Phyſick, piping out of the Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts Braines.</p>

                  <p>The whole world runs a madding in novelties, and our <hi>Engliſh</hi> men will not be left behind, ſuch is the changeable condition of our nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, we cannot be conſtant, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue long in our opinions. And although we be divided from the whole world, <hi>toto diviſi ab orbe Britanni,</hi> yet we agree and joyn with it in novelties. <hi>Gregorie Oxo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nienſis,</hi> the late librarie keeper in <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſaith the Aſtrologers, put our nation under the domination of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and quotes <hi>Roger Bacon</hi> for it. <hi>[Inde intricatioribus &amp; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fundis maxime momentis laborat pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter impeditos motus.]</hi> From hence tis much perplext, by reaſon of the uncertaine motion, in intricate, and deep matters. <hi>Eſwide</hi> quotes
<pb facs="tcp:100330:4"/>an old Aſtrologer, that affirmes, <hi>[Angli ſunt vagi &amp; inſtabiles, nunc ad ſummum, nunc ad imum delati.] Engliſh</hi> men are inconſtant, and uncertaine, now they are elevated to the height, now again are car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to the bottom. Thus our Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitians, that had wont to be carried to the top of <hi>Parnaſſus,</hi> with admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable <hi>Galenical</hi> methode, now they are carried to the bottom of empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical new experiments. Nothing paſſeth for currant now, but new deviſes. And if they cannot frame themſelves to introduce a new opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, they will create a new para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox of an old one, and furbuſh it over with a new aereall ſmooth Language: Thus <hi>[error foecundus est, et quaelibet aetas de veteribus qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſi novos gignit, atque producit.]</hi> Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour is fruitful.

<pb facs="tcp:100330:5"/>let this later age flatter themſelves, and admire their new born fancies, hammerd at the anvil of their own working braines, yet tis not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to obſcure, or obliterate the old dogmatical foundations (which ſo many ages paſt have crowned with eternity) from the glory of their heredity. Shall we dream to ſee more then our Fore-fathers did? have we any new orientall light breaking through the <hi>Chaos,</hi> or darkneſs of their ignorance? No no! theſe are but pleaſing dreams of their own idle Romanſies.

                     </gap>] that is, do that worſe, which was admirably performed before. Now we find out ſuch toyes which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ages have, and poſteriour ſhal eſteem vaine bubbles, and vapours, ſprung from ambition, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as having a more ſublime eſtimation of our own fancies, then of antique, and ſolid literature. Thus our Noveliſts make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the great <hi>Donn's</hi> of Phyſick, at whoſe tribunal we muſt expect the ſentence of life, or death, as from the Laws of <hi>Medes,</hi> and <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> that cannot be revoked. Theſe are the ridiculous trepidations of this age. And I for my part, cannot
<pb facs="tcp:100330:6"/>obtaine of my rational part, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe theſe new fancies, no not ſo much as incline to mine own opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but ſhal ever refer my ſelf to the judgment of antiquity, &amp; there reſt as content, as <hi>[Tityrus ſub tegmine fagi.]</hi> I mean in <hi>Hippocrates</hi> and <hi>Galen,</hi> whom the ignorant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temne, becauſe (I think) they have Majeſty in them, or becauſe they underſtand them not, few will be troubled with their heathen <hi>Greek</hi> Language, <hi>obſcure Phraſes, intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate ſentences,</hi> and ſcrupulous Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod as they ſuppoſe.

                  <p>His queſtion is, whether it be not wholſome for Northern peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that inhabite cold Countries to drink water at their meales, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of beer.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:100330:14"/>by reaſon of the parching heat of the ambient aire, which doth exceedingly heat and inflame, and dry the body.

                  <p>This is the Doctors opinion, and is the ſame with others in cold Countries, where they drink ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt wines, and beers, by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe of their Phyſitians, &amp; this is not without <hi>Hippocratical</hi> authority, whoſe counſel is, to drink <gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>Firſt, as an Element, water is the mother, as heat is the father of all ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Hence the Ancient Poet <hi>Homer.</hi>

                        </gap>] all-ſperme, or all-ſpawn, as if all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary

And when the divine Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſaith, that the Spirit of God mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon the face of the water; This ſpirit is fire (as <hi>Valeſius</hi> expounds) or, as others, heat, which is celeſtiall: <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> call its [<gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>] more divine, attributing a divine efficacy to this heat which moves upon the water, and neſſles as a Hen upon egg; to produce all living creatures; but this conſideration appertains rather to the Philoſopher then to the Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an: therefore I paſſe to the ſecond conſideration.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Water is conſidered as an Aliment, or nouriſhment: and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though according to <hi>Scaliger,</hi> and <hi>Valeſius,</hi> water doth not nouriſh, yet the better part of the learned hold the contrary. And that water nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſheth, is evident by theſe following arguments.</p>
                     <p>Firſt, Water turns to choler according to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 3. acut. 40. [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] water is cholerick to cholerick natures; why may it not turne to other humors, as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:100330:18"/>well as to choler? and conſequently nouriſh?</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Ayre nouriſheth the ſpirits, as <hi>Galen</hi> intimateth: 12. Meth. cap. 5. [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] And why may not water as well nouriſh the more humid parts, as the ayer, aeriall parts?</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Water nouriſheth fiſh, and why not men?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, <hi>Coſtaeus</hi> reports of a Maid in <hi>Germany</hi> that lived ſome years by only water, by the command of <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand</hi> the Emperour.</p>
                     <p>Fifthly, The expreſſe teſtimony of <hi>Plato,</hi> who was numbred among Phyſitians that were [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] that is elegant and were oppoſed [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] to vulgar Phyſitians: <hi>Plato's</hi> words are theſe [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] that is; drynouriſhment nouriſheth the dry parts of the body, ſo doth moyſt and wateriſh nouriſhment, the moyſt.</p>
                     <p>Sixthly, The authority of great <hi>Hippocrates</hi> the prince of all Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans: <hi>lib, de diata</hi> [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>]
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:100330:19"/>that is, fire moves all things, water nouriſheth all things.</p>
                     <p>Seventhly, Water maketh ſome men fat. <hi>[Ego (inquit Hieronymus Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curialis) novi duos magnos principes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quae frigidae uſu ping ue factos:]</hi> I knew (ſaith <hi>Hieronymus Mercurialis</hi>) two great Princes made fat with drinking of water.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Water is conſidered as a Vehicle of nouriſhment, or as I may ſay, a Waggon to carry nouriſhment into all parts of the body; and <hi>Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craſes</hi> calls it [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] that is, a Vehicle or Waggon of nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Valeſius</hi> upon theſe words of <hi>Hippo. [potus, aut eſt tantum potus, ut ſola aqua, non nutrit: aut eſt alimentum in potut]</hi> drink as only drink, as water alone doth not nouriſh, but ſerveth to temper the inward parts, helps con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction (for concoction is a boyling or elixation) and diſtribution. But as I proved before, water doth not only carry down nouriſhment, as a floud carrieth ſticks, ſtones, rubbiſh &amp;c. but nouriſheth.</p>
                     <p>The fourth and laſt conſideration
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:100330:19"/>is, that water is not only an aliment, or nouriſhment, but alſo a medicine, or medicament, and not only [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

For the heat is concentra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by an antiperiſtaſis. But if this be true, then the colder the Country, the hotter, and ſtronger the men for concoction: therefore in the coldeſt Countreyes we may drink water, and in the hotteſt we may drink wine. Secondly, if men be hotter and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coct better in cold Countries, and Winter, how then comes it to paſſe, that we are ſubject to Rhewmes, and fluxes; and generally to all phlegma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tique diſeaſes in ſuch Countreyes, and it Winter time? Therefore to give a full anſwer to this doubt, we

                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>] The cauſe of the palpitation is a groſs clowdy, dark and flatulent ſpirit. Therefore colder ages are ſubject to this palpitation, a cold temper, cold region, winter, an idle life, men given to repretion and much drinking, meats cold, and fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulent, to conclude all in a word, whatſoever cooles the body. And <hi>Galen</hi> addes preſently after, that the ancient Phyſitians found out reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies for the palpation, which do heat, and extenuate, and 4. <hi>de locis affectis:</hi>

But water hath not a heating, and exte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating faculty. Therefore it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be a good Medicine for this Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptome.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, water is no good Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine for the gout. As for a cold gout, I think no rational man will grant cold water a convenient re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. Then for an hot gout, which is a kind of inflammation, 'tis proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that water may do well; but all is not gold that gliſters, nor every argument that is apparently true, is true: For as I ſaid before, they that aime at a few circumſtances are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deceined. There be many to be conſidered in the gout, as <hi>Cardan</hi> tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth, 1. The weakneſs of the joynts. 2. The latitude of the veines. 3. A crude matter. 4. An impulſive power. But if in all gouts there be crudities, water cannot be a good remedy. <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len</hi> forbids water in crudities, leaſt it cauſe more crudities. Wherefore <hi>Galen</hi> commends [<gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                     <p>Thirdly, in dropſies water is worſt of all, for all dropſies are of a cold diſtemper of the liver, whence ſpring flegme, water, wind, which are the brats of a diſtempered liver. <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander Maſſar: [aquae potio ſi quid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liud, aqua inter cutem laborantibus est adverſiſſima, adeo ut Avicenna illius quoqu; viſionem prohibeat.]</hi> The drinking of water is moſt contrary to dropſies, in ſo much that <hi>Avicen</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad to look upon water. <hi>Maſſari</hi> had this from <hi>Galen,</hi> as all rivolets have from the Ocean, for he ſaith [<gap reason="foreign">

                     <p>The ſecond objection is that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quencheth thirſt better then wine: this is the argument. That which actually, and potentially doth moſt coole, and moyſten, quencheth thirſt beſt; but water doth both actually &amp; potentially moſt coole, and moyſten, therefore quench thirſt better then wine: for ſmall wine <gap reason="foreign">

So ſal <hi>Prunellae,</hi> and ſal tartari, although they be hot, coole more being mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with cold water, therefore the minor propoſition is denyed, for tis falſe. And although <hi>Hippocrates</hi> 6. <hi>Epidem.</hi> commends water in hot na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, [<gap reason="foreign">

But becauſe I write againſt cold drink, and warm drink, ſome weak underſtanding, or ſome prickeard critick will imagine, or ſuppoſe that I am like the Satyre that did blow hot and cold. Therefore I thought good, to give, the curteous Reader an account of the difference of theſe two Bookes. For there is no jarring in theſe diſcourſes but may ſtand both, without contradiction or any oppoſition. The firſt Book is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Novellists: This against an unknown Author <hi>Anonymus,</hi> who may be was ſhamed of his name. The first Book is of water only: this is of any drink. The firſt is limited to our Countrey.

And that the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:100330:75"/>may know what theſe termes mean, I will ſet down briefly, what is actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and potentially hot or cold, if I can hit on't. Actually hot is, that which is hot to the ſenſe of feeling or touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſo if a man drink broath, that it doth <hi>amburere guſturem,</hi> as <hi>Plautus</hi> ſaith, this broath is actually hot.

                  <p>But before I come to the maine battalia, I will give you a character of our Authors grand Learning, by which you may know him as <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> by his foot, <hi>ex pede Herculem.</hi> For in his firſt page he ſaith, that <hi>Homer</hi> with great dexterity of wit cals a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of writing <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, a golden chaine. He dreamt of Gold, but tells us nonſenſe: for where did <hi>Homer</hi> call Method a golden chaine.
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:100330:78"/>
                     <hi>Homer</hi> never wrote of Method, his work it ſelf is but a Rapſodie, as the Criticks relate, and of old they that ſang <hi>Homer</hi>'s <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>, and <hi>rapſodoi,</hi> becauſe they ſang patcht verſes. What mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is this? I could not imagine any face could have ſo much braſs, as to tell ſo bold a lye to the Univerſity. For <hi>Homer</hi> ſpeaks no more of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, then he doth <hi>de facie in orbe lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nae,</hi> or of the man in the Moon. And if we believe the divine <hi>Plato,</hi> this golden chaine is the Sun. <hi>Plato</hi> h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s words declaring the golden chaine, are theſe in his <hi>Theaeteto,</hi>

                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, and by the light of this Sun we may ſee the <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>: or ſparkes of our Authors underſtanding. Who (I eaſily believe) did underſtand Greek no more then a Beaſt, yet forſooth he muſt quote <hi>Homer</hi>'s Greek words, to no purpoſe at all.</p>
                  <p>Now I will come to his diſcourſe, which I think is as brutiſh and illite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as the former of Method, and will have as bad ſucceſs, for where
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:100330:79"/>as tis a manifeſt and firme concluſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, never contradicted for theſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years together, by the Learn'deſt all ages. That cold drink is better to quench thirſt then warm, becauſe thirſt is a diſpoſition hot and dry, and therefore requires a cold and moiſt remedy to give it ſatisfaction, ſo <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtoteles</hi> 2. <hi>de anima,</hi> 
                     <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>. Thirſt is an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite of moyſture and coldneſs. Therefore it muſt have drink cold and moyſt. This is an invincible ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. I ſhall not need to put this argument into a Syllogiſtical forme. Every propoſition in <hi>Ariſt.</hi> virtually is a ſyllogiſme. The Learned may know that the argument is grownded up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the great whoele of Phyſick, which is, that contraries are cured by contraries, and that the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt follow <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
                  <p>Yet our incomparable Author brings this argument with great dexterity of wit, (as he ſaid before of <hi>Homer</hi>) to prove warm drink better to quench thirſt then cold. Thus he
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:100330:79"/>bringeth the greateſt ratiocination againſt himſelf, that can be poſſible, as he himſelf in a manner confeſſeth, ſo that he is urged to prove one of theſe reſults.</p>
                  <p>Either that drink actually hot, doth better, coole and moyſten the body then cold drink.</p>
                  <p>Or elſe <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> his meaning is not directly as his words ſeem lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to pretend.</p>

Every one of theſe texts prove that contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are cured by contraries, and three of them prove that cold water cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth not natures, and hot diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; neither is there any rule or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, that can poſſibly contradict them, yet our Author like a true cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick of this later age of new lights, averreth that <hi>Galen's</hi> ground is not to be underſtood literally. It ſeems when any authority croſs our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:100330:87"/>then this not to be underſtood literally: ſure enough all authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are to be underſtood literally or myſtically.

And if <hi>Galen</hi> be not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood literally, then he muſt be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood myſtically.

                  <p>The ſecond reaſon is, becauſe (ſaith our Author) tis not poſſible that every man, woman, &amp; child who being hot, and deſire drink, can up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every motion ſo proportion the cold, that it ſhall juſt fit the degree of heat. And then if it be too ſmall, by its anteperiſtaſis, it hurts where it ſhould help: if greater then the heat require inſtead of allaying the heat, it utterly killeth it] What an admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ridiculous objection is this, and
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:100330:88"/>nothing to the purpoſe, to imagine that every man, woman, and child ſhould give a due proportion of cold? and who can give a due of warm drink? Neither is it requiſite for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one to apply <hi>contrariis contraria aequalia;</hi> but he may apply contraries either greater, or leſs, or aequal, as <hi>Valleſius</hi> witneſs in his controverſies. But (ſaith our Author) if it be too ſmall, by his antiperiſtaſis it hurteth where it ſhould help.] To ſee how men are bewitched to error, and as I may ſay bedevild in their ratiocina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when they forſake antiquity, and follow their own own interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, for then errour begets errour to the end of the Chapter, for if he had read <hi>Theophraſtus,</hi> he would have told me another tale, for he ſaith quite contrary: <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="143" facs="tcp:100330:88"/>heat it utterly killeth it] Here is no conſequence, for we may take drink very cold in ſummer, in hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, and where cuſtom is predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant without any hurt; beſides we need not take our drink too cold, nor very little cold, for there is degree between theſe two colds.
